# Deployment
This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The live site updates automatically each time there is a new push to the repository. You can git clone the code to run it locally on your machine.

Most of the code i did in Code Visual studio 
and deploy it manually from my laptop to github
1. I opened github .
2. I created my milestone repository.
3. I opened my milestone repository folder
4. I clicked add file button and chose update file(on the left side of gitpod button)
5. on the screen will show add file , I clicked there and i chose folder with every file .
6. next i click commit under everything
